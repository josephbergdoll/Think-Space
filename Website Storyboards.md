# Scene 1
“The cubicle is efficient in terms of its space requirements but not especially conducive to communication, concentration, or even flexibility. The closed office makes concentration and private conversation easier, but it is expensive and inflexible and impedes spontaneous, free-form communication.”
FRANKLIN BECKER

# Scene 2
Employee Engagement is an individual’s degree of positive or negative emotional attachment to their organization, their job and their colleagues

# Scene 4



Defined as an individual’s degree of positive or negative emotional attachment to their organization, their job and their colleagues. Engaged employees work harder and are more involved in their office community.

An open office affords employees more exposure to their coworkers. Through increased face-to-face interaction, employees establish better relationships with those around them and are more inclined to work better together as a team.

By cutting down on private office space and physically moving teams closer together, the need for large amounts of square footage is greatly reduced, saving money on rent, furnishings, and utilities.

The previous three benefits add up to the overall goal of this project: improved office environments, higher engagement amongst employees, better office communities, and more work getting done.
