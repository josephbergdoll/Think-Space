<h2>It's time to rethink<br>the workspace.</h2>
<article class="single"><p>The modern office environment is broken. Of the 132.5 million Americans in the workforce, 71% of them are disengaged with their work. Such disengagement is costing companies billions of dollars, and is hampering the quality of life of our workforce. Think Space is a project that aims to bring engagement and productivity back to the American workplace by means of collaborative community based workspaces.<p>
<p>
Think Space advocates open plan office layouts. The problem with most modern day offices is that there is too much private space &ndash; employees are too far away from eachother to form working relationships and work in a cohesively. By knocking down the walls and cubicles and getting employees closer together in communal pod layouts provides a space for new thinking and new ideas, and a greater sense of community amongst employees.</p>
<p>A flexible, open-plan workspace benefits management and employees through:
</p></article>

<ul class="tabs clearfix">

<li class="engagement">
<div class="icon"></div>
<h1>Employee Engagement</h1><p>Defined as an individual's degree of positive or negative emotional attachment to their organization, their job and their colleagues. Engaged employees work harder and are more involved in their office community.</p>
</li>

<li class="dynamic">
<div class="icon"></div>
<h1>Improved Office Dynamic</h1><p>An open office affords employees more exposure to their coworkers. Through increased face-to-face interactions, employees establish better relationships with those who work around them.</p>
</aside>

<li class="rent">
<div class="icon"></div>
<h1>Lower Rent Costs</h1><p>By cutting down on private office space and physically moving teams closer together, the need for large amounts of square footage is greatly reduced, cutting costs by saving money on rent, furnishings, and utilities.</p>
</li>

<li class="productivity">
<div class="icon"></div>
<h1>Increased Productivity</h1><p>The previous three benefits add up to the overall goal of this project: improved office environments, higher engagement amongst employees, better office communities, and more work getting done.</p>

		<h2>Case Study:<br>Fervor Creative</h2>
		<article class="two-col">
		<p>Fervor Creative has been in business in Scottsdale, Arizona for over 13 years, providing their design and strategy services to clients local and nationwide. They moved into their current office in old-town Scottsdale in 2003. The contemporary looking building was built in the 1980s, with the inside floor plan segregated out with a bunch of different walls and small private rooms for the health insurance business that was operating out of the building.</p>
		<p>When owners Don Newlen and Jami Pomponi Alire acquired the building, they hired an architect to break down many of these interior walls to open the space up. Their first office layout in the building was composed of a series of cubicles, with each cube having lots of desk space for its occupant. However, they decided in 2012 that it was time to shake things up in the office and re-think their environment.
When they had first moved into the space, one of the reasons behind the cubicles and the large amounts of desk space was that such space was necessary because of the amount of physical paperwork each employee needed to hold on to for various projects. As time and technology progressed and almost every facet of their business switched to exclusively digital format, much of this desk space became unused. With the old layout, the only true "common area" was a game room that was tucked away in a corner of the floor plan, which was used by some employees but not often. Noticing the diminished need for physical desk space and the increased need for social interaction in their studio, they switched the floor plan around to consolidate the numerous cubicles into three small pods of desks with very close proximity to eachother. They said that this approach has helped facilitate much more collaboration and openness between employees, as there are no more walls to separate them from eachother.</p>

		<p>In the space vacated by old cubicles, Don and Jami expanded the kitchen area from just a small sink into a large countertop area with a bright orange retro fridge. In the kitchen area is a long wooden table with seats enough seats around it for a small group lunch. This is the first time employees have had a place to dine together within the office, away from their desks. They also redid the outer patio to give employees another space to go in case they become tired of their desk.</p>

		Another new addition to the office is the large vintage record player. They bought this to function as a communal alternative to an office stereo. As opposed to employees isolating themselves by sitting at their desks with headphones on, they're engaging in interaction with eachother through playing different songs on the record player. Don told me that employees who don't even own record players at home are now buying vinyl records just so that they can bring them to work to play their favorite jams.

		Each employee I spoke to, as well as the owners, are extremely happy with how the new office is taking shape. The entire team was heavily involved in the creation of the new office layout, and were surveyed by the owners about what they felt the office needed. Fervor isn't quite done with the entire build-out, but they are much happier and much more productive in their new office environment.
